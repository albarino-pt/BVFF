The system uses two key IDC connections:\n\n1. A 20-pin IDC connection interfaces with a separate relay board that manages 5 input relays. These relays are responsible for receiving signals from external control systems, enabling the Arduino to interact with other devices. The system also features two switches: one to power the main control board and another to control the relay board's power.\n2. A 40-pin IDC connection links the Arduino shield to a control panel that handles the operation of bell ringing and gate opening/closing within a fire station. This panel includes various buttons and LEDs for intuitive operation, enabling firefighters to manage key functions efficiently.\n\nThe schematic shows an additional relay system integrated directly into the Arduino Mega shield. These relays are distinct from the external relay board, managing more specific operations such as signaling and LED indicators. Additionally, the system is designed with future expandability in mind, featuring an extra IDC output for future connections to other control boards.\n\nThis project focuses on ensuring robust communication between the Arduino Mega, the relay systems, and the control panel, with an emphasis on reliability, expandability, and ease of installation in demanding environments like fire stations.\n\n### Clean Board View\n\n![A0001 - Clean](/pic/A0001%20-%20Clean.png)\n\n### Schematic\n\n\u003Ciframe src=\"/sch/A0001-Schematic.pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"560px\">\u003C/iframe>\n\n### BOM\n\nYou can view a interactive BOM [here](/bom/BOM_A0001.html).","src/content/blog/A0001.md","d865dc2187bebff0",{"html":22,"metadata":23},"\u003Cp>This project centers around developing a shield for the Arduino Mega that facilitates the control of various systems through a combination of relay boards and button interfaces.
