These relays are responsible for receiving signals from external control systems, enabling the Arduino to interact with other devices. The system also features two switches: one to power the main control board and another to control the relay board's power.\n2. A 40-pin IDC connection links the Arduino shield to a control panel that handles the operation of bell ringing and gate opening/closing within a fire station. This panel includes various buttons and LEDs for intuitive operation, enabling firefighters to manage key functions efficiently.\n\nThe schematic shows an additional relay system integrated directly into the Arduino Mega shield. These relays are distinct from the external relay board, managing more specific operations such as signaling and LED indicators.
