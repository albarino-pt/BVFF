This project goes back to 2019 when I built the hand sodered Evolver sheild for the European robotics festival in Hamburg Germany.
This board has inputs for 3 difrent ultrasonis distance sensors, 2 infra red distance sensors, one tpa84 temperature sensor, two h-bridge motor drivers and one dfrobot color sensor
